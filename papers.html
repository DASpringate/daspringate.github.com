Knight</p><p><h6>Abstract: </h6>Many biological characteristics of evolutionary interest are not scalar variables but continuous functions. Given a dataset of function-valued traits generated by evolution, we develop a practical statistical approach to infer ancestral function-valued traits, and estimate the generative evolutionary process. We do this by combining dimension reduction and phylogenetic Gaussian process regression, a non-parametric procedure which explicitly accounts for known phylogenetic relationships. We test the methods' performance on simulated function-valued data generated from a stochastic evolutionary model. The methods are applied assuming that only the phylogeny and the function-valued traits of taxa at its tips are known. Our method is robust and applicable to a wide range of function-valued data, and also offers a phylogenetically aware method for estimating the autocorrelation of function-valued traits.</p><p></li><li><p><h5><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02360.x/abstract">Correlated response in plasticity to selection for early flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana</a></h5><em>Journal of Evolutionary Biology</em> (2011)</p><p>David Springate, Nora Scarcelli, Jennifer Rowntree, Paula Kover</p><p><h6>Abstract: </h6>Phenotypic plasticity is an important strategy for coping with changing environments. However, environmental change usually results in strong directional selection, and little is known empirically about how this affects plasticity. If genes affecting a trait value also affect its plasticity, selection on the trait should influence plasticity. Synthetic outbred populations of Arabidopsis thaliana were selected for earlier flowering under simulated spring- and winter-annual conditions to investigate the correlated response of flowering time plasticity and its effect on family-by-environment variance (Vg×e) within each selected line. We found that selection affected plasticity in an environmentally dependent manner: under simulated spring-annual conditions, selection increased the magnitude of plastic response but decreased Vg×e; selection under simulated winter-annual conditions reduced the magnitude of plastic response but did not alter Vg×e significantly. As selection may constrain future response to environmental change, the environment for crop breeding and ex situ conservation programmes should be carefully chosen. Models of species persistence under environmental change should also consider the interaction between selection and plasticity.</p><p></li></ul></div><div class="container span1"></div></div><div class="row"><div class="span2"></div><div class="container span8"><footer class="footer"><p class="right back_to_top"><a href="#">&uArr; Page Top</a></p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/datajujitsu">@datajujitsu</a>&nbsp; 2012</p></footer></div></div><script src="/js/prettify.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/lang-clj.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/js/main.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
