    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/social-media-mining-with-r/book">Social Media Mining with R by Nathan Danneman and Richard Heimann</a></p>

<p>[Full disclosure &ndash; I was given a free review copy of the book from the publisher. This review refers to the ebook version]</p>

<p>I worry when a book proposes that it will appeal to everyone.  The trouble is that it could well end up appealing to no-one. The introduction to this new book on social media mining in R says that it will be suitable for skilled programmers with little social science background, people who lack any sort of programming background, people wanting an introduction to social data mining and advanced social science researchers. That doesn&rsquo;t leave many people out!</p>

<p>It turns out that this book doesn&rsquo;t really cover much social media mining.  It does cover basic sentiment analysis and text-mining with some references to twitter data but other social media platforms are barely mentioned and there is no discussion of any of the other social media APIs (e.g. Facebook, Linkedin and Github).  The authors also miss an opportunity to discuss other analysis techniques such as social network analysis and network graphs, which twitter (and other social media) data would be ideal for.</p>

<p>In the first third of the book, much mention is made of big data and how researchers are going to have to prepare for it, but the actual content for dealing with big data (or at least data that would struggle to fit in the RAM of an average laptop) amounts to little more than &ldquo;check that you have enough memory to read in your data and read the manual for the <code>read.table</code> function&rdquo;. R has a reputation for not coping well with large datasets but there are some packages that really assist with this (like <code>fread</code>, <code>data.table</code>, <code>sqldf</code> and <code>dplyr</code>) that could easily have been discussed, along with any number of tips for speeding up I/O using base R functions.</p>

<p>The introductory and background material and theory is interesting and provides a good high level introduction to sentiment analysis, though it still feels somewhat rushed (for example, why completely leave out semi-supervised approaches?  It would have been nice to have at least a page or two describing what they are and why they might be useful) and there is little detail on the assumptions of the different models. The introduction would make a good springboard for deeper research however, and the further reading and bibliography sections are very good.</p>

<p>I like there to be code on nearly every page of a programming book but this one is very light on R code examples. There is a chapter on setting up R and installing packages (This is not going to be anyone&rsquo;s first R book so this chapter feels like a waste, particularly in a book that only clocks in at 120 pages), another covering getting tweets via the <code>twitteR</code> package (but not the streaming API for collecting tweets over a prolonged period of time or any way of storing tweets in a database) and then nothing until two thirds of the way through where there are three short case studies of different methods of sentiment analysis.  It also seems strange to separate out the theory in the earlier chapters and the practical applications later on.</p>

<p>The case studies are mostly decent, covering lexicon-based, naive Bayes and the authors' own unsupervised <em>Item Response Theory</em> sentiment analysis methods.  It seems strange to me in a book on social media mining that the first example doesn&rsquo;t even use social media data, but US government reports which even the authors admit bears little resemblance to twitter data. Some of the code is poorly explained (or not explained at all), idiosyncratic (there may be reasons for using <code>scan</code> to read in a text file, but what are they?) and makes use of out of date packages (Hadley Wickham shipped <code>reshape2</code> back in 2012, why still use <code>reshape</code>?).  The authors miss several opportunities to flesh out the book: One minute they say how important data cleaning is and how useful regular expressions are and then they just point you in the direction of a website teaching regular expressions.  The same is true for the plotting package ggplot2 (Is Wilkinson&rsquo;s <em>The Grammar of Graphics</em> really an appropriate introductory text for this package?) and the <code>rWeka</code> machine learning package.  A lot of the information is good (in particular the description of the <code>tm</code> text-mining package functions) but it all feels a little lightweight, like a collection of blog posts.  The case study analyses were interesting, though choosing such obviously polarised subjects as abortion and Obamacare resulted in much neater, cleaner results than would have been found had subjects been used where opinions are less black-and-white.</p>

<p>Sentiment analysis seems to be everywhere at the moment.  It reminds me of word clouds a few years ago:  Everyone starting out in data science was using them but they soon became a little embarrassing as they became more ubiquitous and were even famously described as the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0405d.shtml">mullets of the internet</a>&rdquo;. Make of it what you will that word clouds are used several times as an analysis method in this book.</p>

<p>Users who have maybe done a Coursera data science course or two and want to try their hand at some simple analyses to boost their portfolio will probably find this book useful but more serious users are likely to be left disappointed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz</p>

<p>[Full disclosure &ndash; I was given a free review copy of the book from the publisher.  This review refers to the ebook version]</p>

<p>This is the most recent of a group of books that try to explore machine learning from a programming, rather than purely mathematical, perspective. The book is highly successful in this respect and deserves a place on the bookshelf of any data scientist, Kaggler or statistician.</p>

<p>The book takes a slightly different tack from previous ones in this field (See &lsquo;Programming Collective Intelligence&rsquo; and &lsquo;Machine learning for Hackers&rsquo;) in that it concentrates largely on the packages themselves and how to use them to solve real world ML problems, rather than focusing on coding up simple algorithms from scratch and running these on toy datasets.  Perhaps this way the book doesn&rsquo;t provide as much insight into how the algorithm design, but it does make the book much more practically useful, particularly since it spends a good chunk of each chapter explaining the algorithm in simple, plain English.</p>

<p>The book is well laid out and written.  Despite a slightly shaky start (do we really still think of ML in terms of Skynet, the Matrix and Hal?), the introduction is excellent and gives a pleasing summary of the philosophical and ethical issues surrounding machine learning and big data. Next, there is a thoughtful introduction to data management and exploratory data analysis that highlights important and often missed tips on things like getting data out of SQL databases.  It introduces some basic R functions and concepts (some I had managed to miss up until now) without feeling like a tacked on &lsquo;R for beginners&rsquo; chapter.</p>

<p>In the guts of the book, each chapter focuses on a group of related algorithms (KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision trees, Regression, Neural nets and SVMs, association rules, clustering) and has a good introduction to the algorithm in question, followed by sections on finding and cleaning data, implementing the algorithm on the data and evaluating and improving model performance. There are clear and easy to understand tables and descriptions of the important distinctions between the algorithms and the reasons for choosing one over another.  The datasets the author has chosen are large and interesting enough to well illustrate the points being made without being frustratingly unwieldy and many of them are &lsquo;classic&rsquo; machine learning datasets from places such as the UCI Machine Learning Data Repository.</p>

<p>Next, the book looks more deeply at evaluating and improving model performance and discusses important ensemble and meta-learning techniques like bagging, boosting and RandomForests.  This section will be of particular interest to people wanting to enter Kaggle or other data science competitions because they show how to milk as much performance as possible from the basic algorithms described earlier in the book.</p>

<p>The final section discusses getting the algorithms to run on big datasets and improving the performance of R itself using tricks like the data.table and ff packages and parallel processing.  This is the only section of the book that feels slightly rushed and many of these topics are discussed only briefly before linking to the relevant package documentation.  This is only small criticism though, since coding up these kinds of systems will depend strongly on the data you have and these are difficult subjects to cover whilst retaining generality.</p>

<p>Obviously, the book cannot cover everything.  It is decidedly light on graphs and has almost nothing on visualisation techniques and packages like ggplot2 which have become almost mandatory for doing data science today. Also, if you are new to R, you really want to get one of the excellent introductory books first and if you are new to ML, you probably want to spend a while learning some basic stats as well.  Finally, this book doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be a deep text about the mathematics of the algorithms it covers.  For that you will need to go for something like Bishop&rsquo;s classic &lsquo;Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning&rsquo; and be prepared to put in some serious effort!</p>

<p>In short, if you are looking for a practical guide to implementing ML algorithms on real data and if you are more comfortable thinking in R code than in mathematical equations, this is the book for you and is the best that I have seen on the subject so far.</p>
