# About me
-----------------------

I am a data scientist working in academia with skills and experience in acquiring, processing, modelling and visualising large and complex datasets.  I am particularly interested in open source software; open data; health informatics and functional, statistical and data programming.

I am employed as a  research fellow in the [Centre for Biostatistics](http://www.population-health.manchester.ac.uk/biostatistics/) and [Centre for Primary Care](http://www.medicine.manchester.ac.uk/primarycare/) at the University of Manchester.  I work with large-scale Electronic Medical Record Databases containing millions of electronically captured doctor-patient consultations across hundreds of GP practices in order to address important questions in public health.  I am also working to improve accessibility to such data.

In 2012 I completed a PhD in evolutionary biology, studying plastic and genetic responses to environmental changes. My previous work has covered a range of topics including evolutionary genetics, artificial life, machine learning, computational biology and bioinformatics.

I have been programming seriously since 2008. I am expert in R and Python and fluent in SQL and Clojure (which is rapidly becoming my favourite language of all). I also speak conversational Common Lisp, Scheme, Processing, C  and Stata. I have skills and experience in acquiring, processing, modelling and visualising large and complicated datasets.

I am a dad of two girls, an [avid reader](/books/), connoisseur of lo-fi indie pop and occasional flamenco guitarist.

# About this site
-----------------------

This site is concerned with my various interests, in and outside of academia.  In particular, data programming, informatics, text-mining and biostatistics. I am interested in open source, open access and open data in academia, bio- and health informatics and distilling complex datasets from a range of sources into meaningful information.

This blog is in its fourth incarnation.  I first hosted it on Blogger before moving it to [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/). Upon the move, I first built the static site in Clojure using the [Misaki](http://github.com/liquidz/misaki) Static site generator, (which I [edited slightly](http://github.com/DASpringate/misaki) to meet my needs).  Then, I changed again to using my own [Samatha](https://github.com/DASpringate/samatha) static site engine which is written entirely in R.  I have now moved to Octopress.  Once I stop messing around with platforms, I may get around to posting more frequently.
