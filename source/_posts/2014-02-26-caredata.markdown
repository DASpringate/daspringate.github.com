This is a post I wrote for [_The Conversation_](http://theconversation.com) on the problems with the new UK Care.data electronic medical record database.  The post was later taken up by BBC news and I appeared on the BBC1 Breakfast show for a televised debate with the GP Gordon Gantz on the benefits of a national medical record database.
