These are the slides from a talk I gave to the [Manchester R user group](http://www.rmanchester.org) on the 6th of May, 2014.

I discussed what web mining(or web scraping) is and the advantages of using R to do it.  Then I provided a toolkit of R functions for Web mining before giving two examples of using web mining for practical uses:

1. Downloading multiple files from a website
2. A mash-up of data from a number of sources to find out the best places to apply for a new job in academia!
