# Collaboration and Consulting

## Academia

I am always interested in setting up new collaborations and am happy to provide advice and code to help with research design, statistical programming, data analysis, informatics and visualisation.  I work in quantitative healthcare and health informatics, but I also have experience in quantitative genetics, ecology and computational biology.

* R
* Data mining / Machine learning
* Building data pipelines and workflows
* Web mining
* Social media analytics
* Python / Django
* Clojure / Functional programming

Get in contact and we can chat.
