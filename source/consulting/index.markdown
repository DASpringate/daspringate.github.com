# Collaboration and Consulting

## Academia

I am always interested in setting up new collaborations and am happy to provide advice and code to help with research design, statistical programming, data analysis, informatics and visualisation.  I work in quantitative healthcare and health informatics, but I also have experience in quantitative genetics, ecology and computational biology.

## Other

I am interested in new startup ideas in big data, e-health, smart cities and future farming and may be available for collaboration and consultancy. Get in contact and we can chat.
