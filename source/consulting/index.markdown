# Collaboration and Consulting

I am always interested in setting up new collaborations and am happy to provide advice and code to help with research design, statistical programming, data analysis, informatics and visualisation.  I work in quantitative healthcare and health informatics, but I also have experience in quantitative genetics, ecology and computational biology.
